## Selected Design: Bureaucratic Minimalism

I have selected **Response 1: Bureaucratic Minimalism** as the design approach. This design best captures the satirical essence of $DOGEGOV—a government department that looks official and serious while delivering the ironic message that it's designed to delete itself.

### Design Philosophy Applied:
- **Official Aesthetic:** Deep Navy and Gold create an authentic government feel
- **Surgical Precision:** Minimal design with maximum impact
- **Visual Irony:** Red scissors and strikethrough text reinforce the "deletion" narrative
- **Typography Focus:** Serif fonts (Playfair Display) for authority, clean body text for readability
- **Asymmetric Layout:** Staggered sections create visual interest without chaos
- **Deletion Metaphor:** Clip-path animations and cutting effects throughout

This approach ensures the website feels like an official government department filing its own termination paperwork—exactly as specified in the requirements.
